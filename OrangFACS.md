### What OrangFACS is:
The Orangutan Facial Action Coding System (OrangFACS) is a scientific observational tool for identifying and coding facial movements in Orangutans. The system is based on the facial anatomy of Orangutans and has been adapted from the original FACS system used for humans created by Ekman and Friesen (1978). The OrangFACS manual details how to use the system and code the facial movements of Orangutans objectively. The manual and certification is freely available (see below). 

More info regarding the development of this FACS system can be found here:

### What MaqFACS isn't:
MaqFACS is not an ethogram of facial expressions, and does not make any inference about any underlying emotion or context causing the movement. Instead this is an objective coding scheme with no assumption about what represents a facial expression in this species. It will not explicitally teach you macaque facial expressions

### Accessing the manual
The OrangFACS Manual is freely available via the link below

## Accessing the test
To become a certified OrangFACS coder, we encourage you to take the associated test. The OrangFACS test involves trainees to accurately code the facial movements in a series of video clips. 

The test can be accessed here: [OrangFACS Test materials](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C3i_wLeylxyo1s6BbTn2eEWglau6cetT?usp=drive_link)

Once completed. Return the completed test of animalfacsuk@gmail.com, along with 
1) Your name
2) Your intitution
3) Your reason for persuing OrangFACS certification.
