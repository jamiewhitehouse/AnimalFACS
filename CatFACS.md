### What CatFACS is:
The Cat Facial Action Coding System (CatFACS) is a scientific observational tool for identifying and coding facial movements in domestic cats. The system is based on the facial anatomy of cats and has been adapted from the original FACS system used for humans created by Ekman and Friesen (1978). The CatFACS manual details how to use the system and code the facial movements of cats objectively. The manual and certification is freely available (see below). 

More info regarding the development of this FACS system can be found here:

Applied Animal Behaviour Science 189 (2017): 66-78._](Caeiro, Cátia C., Anne M. Burrows, and Bridget M. Waller. "Development and application of CatFACS: Are human cat adopters influenced by cat facial expressions?." Applied Animal Behaviour Science 189 (2017): 66-78.)

### What CatFACS isn't:
CatFACS is not an ethogram of facial expressions, and does not make any inference about any underlying emotion or context causing the movement. Instead this is an objective coding scheme with no assumption about what represents a facial expression in this species. It will not explicitally teach you Cat facial expressions

### Accessing the manual

## Accessing the test
To become a certified CatFACS coder, we encourage you to take the associated test. The CatFACS test involves trainees to accurately code the facial movements in a series of video clips.

The test can be accessed here: [CatFACS Test materials](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SL33mk3I3etG4hvt0gLydHTaCkvUyRo8?usp=drive_link)

Once completed. Return the completed test of animalfacsuk@gmail.com, along with:
1) Your name
2) Your intitution
3) Your reason for persuing CatFACS certification. 

## The people behind it

CatFACS was developed thanks to the joint effort of:

**Bridget M. Waller**, Department of Psychology, Nottingham Trent University. 
**Anne M. Burrows,** Department of Physical Therapy, Duquesne University
