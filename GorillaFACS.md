### What GorillaFACS is:
The Gorilla Facial Action Coding System (GorillaFACS) is a scientific observational tool for identifying and coding facial movements in Gorillas (_Gorilla sp._). The system is based on the facial anatomy of gorillas and has been adapted from the original FACS system used for humans created by Ekman and Friesen (1978). The CalliFACS manual details how to use the system and code the facial movements of gorillas objectively. The manual and certification is freely available (see below). 

More info regarding the development of this FACS system can be found here:

[_Correia-Caeiro, C., Costa, R., Hayashi, M., Burrows, A., Pater, J., Miyabe-Nishiwaki, T., ... & Liebal, K. (2025). GorillaFACS: The Facial Action Coding System for the Gorilla spp. PloS one, 20(1), e0308790._](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308790)

### What GorillaFACS isn't:
GorillaFACS is not an ethogram of facial expressions, and does not make any inference about any underlying emotion or context causing the movement. Instead this is an objective coding scheme with no assumption about what represents a facial expression in this species. It will not explicitally teach you gorilla facial expressions

### Accessing the manual

## Accessing the test
To become a certified GorillaFACS coder, we encourage you to take the associated test. The GorillaFACS test involves trainees to accurately code the facial movements in a series of video clips.

To access the test materials, please contact catia_caeiro@hotmail.com along with the following information:

1) Your name
2) Your intitution
3) Your reason for persuing GorillaFACS certification.
