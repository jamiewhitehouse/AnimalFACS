### What CalliFACS is:
The Marmoset Facial Action Coding System (CalliFACS) is a scientific observational tool for identifying and coding facial movements in common marmosets (_Callithrix jacchus_). The system is based on the facial anatomy of marmosets and has been adapted from the original FACS system used for humans created by Ekman and Friesen (1978). The CalliFACS manual details how to use the system and code the facial movements of marmosets objectively. The manual and certification is freely available (see below). 

More info regarding the development of this FACS system can be found here:

[_Caeiro C, Burrows A, Wilson D, Abdelraman A, Miyabe-Nishiwaki T. (2022) CalliFACS: The Common Marmoset Facial Action Coding, PLoS ONE System. 10.1371/journal.pone.0266442_](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266442)

### What CalliFACS isn't:
CalliFACS is not an ethogram of facial expressions, and does not make any inference about any underlying emotion or context causing the movement. Instead this is an objective coding scheme with no assumption about what represents a facial expression in this species. It will not explicitally teach you common marmoset facial expressions

### Accessing the manual
The CalliFACS Manual is freely available via the link below

## Accessing the test
To become a certified CalliFACS coder, we encourage you to take the associated test. The CalliFACS test involves trainees to accurately code the facial movements in a series of video clips.

The test can be accessed here: [CalliFACS Test materials](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NA5pRVHTGoFBUfXVsv3pJyqNvB6TzhpK?usp=drive_link)

Once completed. Return the completed test of animalfacsuk@gmail.com, along with:
1) Your name
2) Your intitution
3) Your reason for persuing CalliFACS certification.
