### What GibbonFACS is:
The Gibbon Facial Action Coding System (GibbonFACS) is a scientific observational tool for identifying and coding facial movements in hylobatids. The system is based on the facial anatomy of gibbons and has been adapted from the original FACS system used for humans created by Ekman and Friesen (1978). The GibbonFACS manual details how to use the system and code the facial movements of hylobatids objectively. The manual and certification is freely available (see below). 

More info regarding the development of this FACS system can be found here:

[_Waller, B. M., Lembeck, M., Kuchenbuch, P., Burrows, A. M., & Liebal, K. (2012). GibbonFACS: a muscle-based facial movement coding system for hylobatids. International Journal of Primatology, 33(4), 809-821._](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10764-012-9611-6)

### What GibbonFACS isn't:
GibbonFACS is not an ethogram of facial expressions, and does not make any inference about any underlying emotion or context causing the movement. Instead this is an objective coding scheme with no assumption about what represents a facial expression in this species. It will not explicitally teach you chimpanzee facial expressions

## Accessing the test
To become a certified GibbonFACS coder, we encourage you to take the associated test. The GibbonFACS test involves trainees to accurately code the facial movements in a series of video clips
