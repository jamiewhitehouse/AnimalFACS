### What CatFACS is:
The Horse Facial Action Coding System (EquiFACS) is a scientific observational tool for identifying and coding facial movements in horses. The system is based on the facial anatomy of horses and has been adapted from the original FACS system used for humans created by Ekman and Friesen (1978). The EquiFACS manual details how to use the system and code the facial movements of horses objectively. The manual and certification is freely available (see below). 

More info regarding the development of this FACS system can be found here:

[_Wathan, J., Burrows, A. M., Waller, B. M., & McComb, K. (2015). EquiFACS: the equine facial action coding system. PLoS one, 10(8), e0131738._](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131738)

### What EquiFACS isn't:
EquiFACS is not an ethogram of facial expressions, and does not make any inference about any underlying emotion or context causing the movement. Instead this is an objective coding scheme with no assumption about what represents a facial expression in this species. It will not explicitally teach you horse facial expressions

## Accessing the test
To become a certified EquiFACS coder, we encourage you to take the associated test. The EquiFACS test involves trainees to accurately code the facial movements in a series of video clips.

**Anne M. Burrows,** Department of Physical Therapy, Duquesne University
**Karen McComb,** University of Sussex



### Acknowledgments

We would like to thank countless owners for letting us video their horses. Particular thanks must go to Sussex Horse Rescue Trust, Bowler’s Riding School, and Little Park Farm. Katie Slocombe, Will Teasley and Becky Spooner helped with the collection of video data. We are grateful to Cátia Caeiro and Karen Schmidt for valuable advice, and also thanks to Cátia, Kate Grounds, Amy Smith, and Charlotte Lillis for help with the reliability coding. We must credit and thank Tim Smith for the anatomical drawing. Perry Habecker at the New Bolton Centre, University of Pennsylvania, sourced the specimen for the dissection. Emily Durham deserves a huge thank you for dealing with the specimen and thanks to Helen Spence for giving a second opinion on the age of the horse.
