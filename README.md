# What is AnimalFACS? (Facial Action Coding System)

The Animal Facial Action Coding System is an observational scientific tool, allowing for an objective measurement of facial movement in non-human animals, allowing for the analysis of facial behaviour in animals. 

By studying FACS you can learn how to identify specific and subtle muscle movements in the face, allowing for the study of facial communication without subjection categorising whole-expressions.

Each FACS coding scheme has been adapted from the original human-based FACS system, allowing researchers to directly compare muscle-movements between humans and animals, and between animals of different species.
