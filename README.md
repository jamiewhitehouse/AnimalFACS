# What is AnimalFACS? (Facial Action Coding System)

The Animal Facial Action Coding System is an observational scientific tool, allowing for an objective measurement of facial movement in non-human animals, allowing for the analysis of facial behaviour in animals. 

By studying FACS you can learn how to identify specific and subtle muscle movements in the face, allowing for the study of facial communication without subjection categorising whole-expressions.

Each FACS coding scheme has been adapted from the original human-based FACS system, allowing researchers to directly compare muscle-movements between humans and animals, and between animals of different species. 

# The 9 AnimalFACS systems

At present, the FACS system has been adapted to 9 different species. All of which have manuals that are freely accessible. 

#### ChimpFACS [(Access here)](https://animalfacs.github.io/AnimalFACS/ChimpFACS) : A FACS system adapted for use with common chimpanzees _(Pan troglodytes)_
#### MaqFACS [(Access here)](https://animalfacs.github.io/AnimalFACS/MaqFACS) : A FACS system adapted for use with rhesus macaques _(Macaca mulatta)_
#### GibbonFACS [(Access here)](https://animalfacs.github.io/AnimalFACS/GibbonFACS) : A FACS system adapted for use with hylobatid species
#### OrangFACS [(Access here)](https://animalfacs.github.io/AnimalFACS/OrangFACS) : A FACS system adapted for use with Orangutans _(pongo spp.)_
#### DogFACS [(Access here)](https://animalfacs.github.io/AnimalFACS/DogFACS) : A FACS system adapted for use with domestic dog _(Canis lupis familiaris)_
#### CatFACS [(Access here)](https://animalfacs.github.io/AnimalFACS/CatFACS) : A FACS system adapted for use with cats _(Felis catus)_
#### EquiFACS [(Access here)](https://animalfacs.github.io/AnimalFACS/EquiFACS) : A FACS system adapted for use with domestic horses _(Equus ferus caballus)_
#### CalliFACS [(Access here)](https://animalfacs.github.io/AnimalFACS/CalliFACS) : A FACS system adapted for use with marmoset species
#### GorillaFACS [(Access here)](https://animalfacs.github.io/AnimalFACS/GorillaFACS) : A FACS system adapted for use with Gorillas (_Gorilla sp._)



# How it works?

### 1 Access and study the manuals. 
Visit the page of the FACS system you wish to learn, follow the instructions to gain access to the manual.
### 2 Take the test. 
Each FACS system has an accompanied test, allowing individuals to become recognised FACS coders. In the test, your coding will be compared to other certified FACS coders to ensure you are using the system reliably. This is free of charge. Instructions for the tests will appear in the accompanying worksheet.
### 3 Apply FACS to your work. 
Once certified, you are then free to apply FACS in your research, or profession, to objectively quantify the facial movements of your subject animals.
