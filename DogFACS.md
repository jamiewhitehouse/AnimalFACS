### What ChimpFACS is:
The Chimpanzee Facial Action Coding System (DogFACS) is a scientific observational tool for identifying and coding facial movements in domestic dogs. The system is based on the facial anatomy of dogs and has been adapted from the original FACS system used for humans created by Ekman and Friesen (1978). The DogFACS manual details how to use the system and code the facial movements of dogs objectively. The manual and certification is freely available (see below). 

More info regarding the development of this FACS system can be found here:

[_Waller, B. M., Peirce, K., Caeiro, C. C., Scheider, L., Burrows, A. M., McCune, S., & Kaminski, J. (2013). Paedomorphic facial expressions give dogs a selective advantage. PLoS one, 8(12), e82686._](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082686)

### What DogFACS isn't:
DogFACS is not an ethogram of facial expressions, and does not make any inference about any underlying emotion or context causing the movement. Instead this is an objective coding scheme with no assumption about what represents a facial expression in this species. It will not explicitally teach you dog facial expressions

### Accessing the manual

## Accessing the test
To become a certified DogFACS coder, we encourage you to take the associated test. The DogFACS test involves trainees to accurately code the facial movements in a series of video clips.

The test can be accessed here: [DogFACS Test materials](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sgKfRdqpqzEj59gS1qyrsRvbZfVoI8Ri?usp=drive_link)

Once completed. Return the completed test of animalfacsuk@gmail.com, along with:
1) Your name
2) Your intitution
3) Your reason for persuing DogFACS certification.
