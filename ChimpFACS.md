### What ChimpFACS is:
The Chimpanzee Facial Action Coding System (ChimpFACS) is a scientific observational tool for identifying and coding facial movements in chimpanzees. The system is based on the facial anatomy of chimpanzees and has been adapted from the original FACS system used for humans created by Ekman and Friesen (1978). The ChimpFACS manual details how to use the system and code the facial movements of chimpanzees objectively. The manual and certification is freely available (see below). 

More info regarding the development of this FACS system can be found here:

Parr, L. A., Waller, B. M., Vick, S. J., & Bard, K. A. (2007). Classifying chimpanzee facial expressions using muscle action. Emotion, 7(1), 172.

### What ChimpFACS isn't:
ChimpFACS is not an ethogram of facial expressions, and does not make any inference about any underlying emotion or context causing the movement. Instead this is an objective coding scheme with no assumption about what represents a facial expression in this species. It will not explicitally teach you chimpanzee facial expressions
